	abstract = {Many biological processes, such as the cell division cycle, are reflected in protein covariation across single cells. This covariation can be quantified and interpreted by single-cell mass-spectrometry (MS) with sufficiently high throughput and accuracy. Towards this goal, we developed nPOP, a method that uses piezo acoustic dispensing to isolate individual cells in 300 picoliter volumes and performs all subsequent sample preparation steps in small droplets on a fluorocarbon-coated slide. This design enabled simultaneous sample preparation of thousands of single cells, including lysing, digesting, and labeling individual cells in volumes of 8-20 nl. Protein covariation analysis identified cell-cycle dynamics that were similar across cell types and dynamics that differed between cell types, even within sub-populations of melanoma cells defined by markers for drug-resistance priming. The melanoma cells expressing these markers accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, displayed distinct protein covariation across the cell cycle, accumulated glycogen, and had lower abundance of glycolytic enzymes. The non-primed melanoma cells exhibited gradients of protein abundance and covariation, suggesting transition states. These results were validated by different MS methods. Together, they demonstrate that protein covariation across single cells may reveal functionally concerted biological differences between closely related cell states.Competing Interest StatementJoshua Cantlon is an employee of Scienion.},

	abstract = {Missing values are a notable challenge when analysing mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. While the field is still actively debating on the best practices, the challenge increased with the emergence of mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics and the dramatic increase in missing values. A popular approach to deal with missing values is to perform imputation. Imputation has several drawbacks for which alternatives exist, but currently imputation is still a practical solution widely adopted in single-cell proteomics data analysis. This perspective discusses the advantages and drawbacks of imputation. We also highlight 5 main challenges linked to missing value management in single-cell proteomics. Future developments should aim to solve these challenges, whether it is through imputation or data modelling. The perspective concludes with recommendations for reporting missing values, for reporting methods that deal with missing values and for proper encoding of missing values.},

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.},

	abstract = {An idealized version of a label-free discovery mass spectrometry proteomics experiment would provide absolute abundance
measurements for a whole proteome, across varying conditions. Unfortunately, this ideal is not realized. Measurements are made on
peptides requiring an inferential step to obtain protein level estimates. The inference is complicated by experimental factors
that necessitate relative abundance estimation and result in widespread non-ignorable missing data. Relative abundance on the log
scale takes the form of parameter contrasts. In a complete-case analysis, contrast estimates may be biased by missing data and a
substantial amount of useful information will often go unused., To avoid problems with missing data, many analysts have turned to single imputation solutions. Unfortunately, these methods
often create further difficulties by hiding inestimable contrasts, preventing the recovery of interblock information and failing
to account for imputation uncertainty. To mitigate many of the problems caused by missing values, we propose the use of a Bayesian
selection model. Our model is tested on simulated data, real data with simulated missing values, and on a ground truth dilution
experiment where all of the true relative changes are known. The analysis suggests that our model, compared with various
imputation strategies and complete-case analyses, can increase accuracy and provide substantial improvements to interval
coverage.},
